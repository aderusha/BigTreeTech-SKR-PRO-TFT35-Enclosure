![Model](https://github.com/aderusha/BigTreeTech-SKR-PRO-TFT35-Enclosure/blob/main/images/BigTreeTech-SKR-PRO-TFT35-Enclosure-transparent.png?raw=true)

This project offers a 3D printable enclosure for a combination of the BigTreeTech SKR-Pro v1.2 controller along with a TFT35 touchscreen LCD.  Highlights:

* All models are provided in print orientation and require no supports
* M3 fasteners are used throughout and M3 nuts are used to securely fix them in place
* The pedestal mount allows for internal cable routing and can be rotated, allowing the enclosure to be mounted horizontally or vertically
* Mounting holes are provided on the bottom of the enclosure for countersunk #8 wood screws
* Mounting holes and fan grill provided for 40mm fan
* Cable egress slot over stepper connectors
* Access to reset buttons on controller and LCD
* Access to SD cards and USB ports on controller and LCD
* An optional model is provided with a light pipe, allowing the TFT35 LEDs to be iluminate the control knob
* Source CAD model provided and the project is permissively licensed

## Models

### SKR Pro controller enclosure
* **[BigTreeTech_SKR-PRO-v1.2_Bottom.stl](BigTreeTech_SKR-PRO-v1.2_Bottom.stl)** Bottom half of CNC controller enclosure, this part has two mounting studs for [#8 wood screws](https://amzn.to/3oEBPKy) to fasten it to an available horizontal or vertical surface.  Has 4x M3 nut traps to catch screws, should fit tight but you can secure the nuts with CA if needed.
* **[BigTreeTech_SKR-PRO-v1.2_Top.stl](BigTreeTech_SKR-PRO-v1.2_Top.stl)** Top half of CNC controller enclosure, has fan mount for a [40mm fan](https://amzn.to/3DpozgQ)
* **[45deg_Pedestal.stl](45deg_Pedestal.stl)** Mount fastens to both CNC controller and LCD.  Rotate as needed for various mounting options. Model has an interior channel allowing you to route cables between the controller and LCD.  M3 nut traps are provided for fasteners, fit is intentionally tight.  You might need to push them into place with the short end of an Allen wrench and secure with CA glue as needed.

### TFT35 touchscreen LCD enclosure
* **[BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Bottom.stl](BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Bottom.stl)** Bottom half of LCD enclosure, has 4x M3 nut traps to catch screws, should fit tight but you can secure the nuts with CA if needed.
* **[BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Top.stl](BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Top.stl)** Top half of LCD enclosure.  Print this model instead of the two below if you don't care about the LED or if you don't have clear filament available.
* **[BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Top_with_Light_Pipe.stl](BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Top_with_Light_Pipe.stl)** Top half of LCD enclosure with a cutout for the LED light pipe allowing the LCD panel's color LEDs to be visible.
* **[BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Light_Pipe.stl](BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Light_Pipe.stl)** Light pipe for use with the model above.  Print in clear filament to allow light from the LCD panel's color LEDs to be visible.
* **[BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Knob.stl](BigTreeTech_TFT35-E3_v3.0_Knob.stl)** Knob for the LCD.  Prints upside-down so supports aren't needed, add a filament change for the top 2mm and switch to a clear filament to create a ring of light around the base of the knob!
